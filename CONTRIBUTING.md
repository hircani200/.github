# Contribution guide

First, thank you for contributing! We love and encourage pull requests from
everyone. Please follow the guidelines:

- Check open issues and pull requests for existing discussions, maybe your
  problem is already there.
- If not, open an issue first, to discuss a new feature or enhancement.
- If you're changing code, write tests, and make sure the test suite passes
  locally and on CI.
- Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).
- Make sure your commits are logically separated and have good comments
  explaining the details of your change (see [git.md](git.md) as well).
- After receiving feedback, amend your commits or add new ones as
  appropriate.
- **Have fun!**

## Development Workflow

Start by forking the repository, make changes in a branch and then send a pull
request. We encourage pull requests to discuss code changes.
